    "### Abstract\n",
    "Bike-sharing systems are key to sustainable urban transportation, reducing traffic and promoting healthier lifestyles. The dataset includes hourly and daily bike rental counts from Capital Bikeshare (2011-2012) with weather, seasonal, and temporal data. This analysis explores how weather affects rental patterns across seasons and whether rental numbers differ between weekdays and weekends, providing insights to optimize bike-sharing systems.\n",
